# Atmospheric Models
------
Longwave radiation (LWMod_KokSteiner.R)
------
Derive incoming longwave radiation for based on  de Kok et al. (2019)  https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/joc.6249 The model has been developed for hourly data. Coarser time steps are likely also possible.

# Debris-covered glaciers (dcg)
------
Air to surface temperature (AirSurfTemp.R)
------
Derive air temperature measurements on debris cover from surface temperature measurements (or reverse). Based on Steiner & Pellicciotti (2016)
